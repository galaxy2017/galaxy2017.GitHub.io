Next, non-linear planning is used to coordinate the operation of each building over the next 24 hours. For validation, the developed control has been tested on a real building complex in Ludvika, Sweden.

The article proposes an optimized power distribution method using two isolated soft-switched symmetrical half-bridge bidirectional converters connecting a battery and a supercapacitor as a composite structure for the protection structure. The article mentions that hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is an effective method to improve the performance of electric vehicles and extend the battery life. In such systems, batteries and supercapacitors are connected in parallel to provide higher peak power and better energy management. The article proposes a novel HESS structure in which two isolated soft-switched symmetrical half-bridge bidirectional converters are used to connect the battery and the supercapacitor. This structure provides better protection and can be optimized for energy management through an improved energy distribution strategy based on SOC control. This strategy allows the supercapacitor to be charged and discharged at a peak current of about 4ibat and can be adapted to different types of load profiles. Experimental results show that the use of this HESS structure and energy allocation strategy can improve the acceleration performance of electric vehicles by about 50% and reduce energy losses by about 69% compared to the battery-only mode. This approach not only improves energy utilization, but also reduces battery aging effects."),(0,n.kt)("h1",{id:"\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5468"},"\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5468"),(0,n.kt)("h2",{id:"003-adaptive-de-algorithm-for-novel-energy-control-framework-based-on-edge-computing-in-iiot-applications"},"003 Adaptive DE Algorithm for Novel Energy Control Framework Based on Edge Computing in IIoT Applications"),(0,n.kt)("blockquote",null,(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"DOI 10.1109/TII.2020.3007644")),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"This is a paper on a novel energy control framework based on edge computing for industrial IoT applications. The paper proposes an efficient energy control framework to reduce energy waste and increase benefits for industrial users through edge computing. For this purpose, battery storage systems are used to store energy to ensure supply stability and power quality. With this framework, the optimal load pattern and the corresponding storage capacity of the battery storage system can be obtained based on historical load data from energy markets and industrial users. However, calculating these requires consideration of trade-offs between equipment costs, time-of-use tariffs, operating costs, and other relevant factors, which would be an NP-hard problem.

The authors first present task caching on edge clouds, which is the first study of task caching in mobile edge computing. The article further investigates task caching and offloading policies that determine which tasks should be cached and how many tasks should be offloaded. The goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while satisfying user latency requirements. The authors formulate this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and propose an efficient algorithm to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme in this paper has a lower energy cost compared to other schemes. Future work will consider multiple edge cloud task caching and offloading strategies. The experimental results show that the energy cost of mobile devices can be effectively reduced by rational deployment of cache location and task offloading."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
