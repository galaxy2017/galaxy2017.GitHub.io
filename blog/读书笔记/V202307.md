## 001  Energy-Efficient Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in OFDMA-Based Collaborative Edge Computing



This article is a study on OFDMA-based collaborative mobile edge computing (C-MEC). The article first introduces the background and advantages of C-MEC, and then presents a joint optimization problem for task offloading, collaborative decision making, and resource allocation. The article models a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of all mobile users while satisfying task delay constraints. Since this problem is NP-hard, the article proposes a two-layer framework of alternating methods to solve it. In the first layer, the article utilizes an ant colony system (ACS)-based heuristic algorithm to optimize task offloading decisions; in the second layer, the article utilizes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on deep Q-networks (DQN) to optimize resource allocation. The article verifies the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy efficiency and task completion rate through simulation experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption of mobile users and ensure the task completion within the specified time. In addition, the convergence and robustness of the algorithm are analyzed in the paper.



## 002  The Case for FPGA-Based Edge Computing

 

This article focuses on an FPGA-based edge computing model that takes advantage of the customizability of FPGAs and the low latency of edge computing to accelerate the response time and save energy of mobile interactive applications. The article selects three typical computer vision applications as case studies, namely, handwritten digit recognition, object recognition, and face detection. The article experimentally compares the performance of four schemes: FPGA edge offload, CPU edge offload, CPU cloud offload, and mobile local processing, and the results show that FPGA edge offload outperforms the other schemes in terms of response time, execution time, and energy consumption. The article also explores data parallel processing methods between mobile and edge nodes to further reduce the response time of batch requests. The article concludes with a discussion of the advantages, limitations, and future research directions of the FPGA edge computing model.
